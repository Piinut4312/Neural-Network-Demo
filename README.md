# Neural Network Demo
Creating neural network from scratch, train it on multiple synthetic datasets, and visualize the results.

In this project, no machine learning/deep learning libraries are used. Instead, I used NumPy to implement neural networks and gradient descent algorithm.
The GUI is created using PySide6.
